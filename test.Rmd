Surrount your math in $ symbols

Uses Latex markup language for equations as input.

Some nice examples of commonly used greek symbols and functions more latex

$$ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=i}^{n} x_{i} $$

```{r sun, echo=T}
sun=read.table("sun.txt", header=T)
head(sun)
range(sun$year)
# divide into 3 period, beginning, middle, end
sun$period = ifelse(sun$year %in% c(1944,1945, 1946),"start",
              ifelse(sun$year %in%  c(1953,1954),"middle","end"))
boxplot(sun$Kdown_direct~sun$period)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
